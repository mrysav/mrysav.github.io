      <p>
        I am available for paid support and feature development on the
        <a href="http://c4gblis.org/">C4G BLIS project</a>. <b>BLIS is
        free software,</b> but I can provide specific help for your use
        of BLIS for a fee.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been one of the primary developers on this project since 2022.
        My largest contributions have been to create the online, cloud-based
        version of BLIS (BLIS-on-Docker) and the
        <a href="https://github.com/C4G/blis-cloud-cli">"blis" tool</a> for
        administering it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from BLIS, I have worked at several large cloud-based software
        companies including AWS, GitHub, and Microsoft. You can check out my
        <a href="https://github.com/mrysav">GitHub profile</a> 
        for some more details about the work I have done.
      </p>

        for details on how we can help you.
