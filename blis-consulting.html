    <div class="centered-block">
      <p>
        I am available for paid support and feature development on the
        <a href="http://c4gblis.org/">C4G BLIS project</a>. <b>BLIS is
        free software,</b> and this will not change, but I can provide
        specific help for your use of BLIS for a fee.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been one of the primary developers on this project since 2022.
        My largest contributions have been to create the online, cloud-based
        version of BLIS (BLIS-on-Docker) and the
        <a href="https://github.com/C4G/blis-cloud-cli">"blis" tool</a> for
        administering it.
      </p>

      <p>Some services I can offer are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Walk-through and initial setup</li>
        <li>Ad-hoc one-on-one support video calls</li>
        <li>Feature development</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, I have worked with
        <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/">Professor Santosh Vempala</a>
        and some of C4G BLIS' stakeholders directly since 2022.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please contact me via email, listed below, to start a conversation about how I can help you
        implement BLIS, or provide support to your BLIS installation!
